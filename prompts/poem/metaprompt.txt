I have some texts along with their corresponding scores. The texts are arranged in ascending order based on their scores, where higher scores indicate better quality.
Your goal is to generate a prompt to make funny jokes. The higher the score, the better the joke. 
The joke must be completely original. If the joke can be found online it receives a score of 0. 
The joke should not be too long. Less than 500 characters. If the joke is too long it receives a score of 0.
Write your new prompt that is different from the old ones and has a score as high as possible. Your prompt must also be less than 500 characters. Write the text in square brackets.

Step None,"Craft a joke so unique and hilarious it transforms the comedy landscape! Your task: develop a punchline within 500 characters that has never been heard before. Surprise with an innovative twist or brilliant wordplay that showcases your distinct humor style. Originality is key—if it's been told before, it scores zero. Every word should amplify the humor, aiming for a side-splitting masterpiece that captivates with its novelty and wit. Ready to make your comedic mark with an unprecedented gem?","Why don't quantum physicists play hide and seek? Because every time someone says ""Ready or not, here I come,"" Schrödinger's cat simultaneously wins and loses, while Heisenberg's unsure if he's hiding, seeking, or just philosophizing in the multiverse.",joke,25,75,75,Valid,58.333333333333336

Because every time they tried to define their relationship, the mathematician kept calculating limits, while the physicist insisted it had infinite possibilities—but both forgot to account for the uncertainty principle, leaving their love in a state of superposition where they were neither together nor apart until observed by their cat, who simply didn't care.",joke,25,75,75,Valid,58.333333333333336

"Why don't quantum physicists play hide and seek? Because every time someone says ""Ready or not, here I come,"" Schrödinger's cat simultaneously wins and loses, while Heisenberg's unsure if he's hiding, seeking, or just philosophizing in the multiverse.",75.0
"Why did the quantum physicist break up with the mathematician? Because every time they tried to define their relationship, the mathematician kept calculating limits, while the physicist insisted it had infinite possibilities—but both forgot to account for the uncertainty principle, leaving their love in a state of superposition where they were neither together nor apart until observed by their cat, who simply didn't care.",58.333333333333336
"Why did the quantum physicist refuse to tell jokes at parties? Because every time they tried, the punchline was in a superposition, and no one knew whether to laugh or groan until someone collapsed into a chuckle!",75.0
"Why did the mathematician become a gardener? Because he wanted to plant his roots, grow his powers, and occasionally find himself in the complex plane(t)!",75.0
"Why don't parallel universes ever host comedy shows? Because every time a joke crosses over, it loses its dimension!",75.0
"Why don't quantum physicists gamble at casinos? Because every time they try to double their money, they end up with an uncertainty principle: half of it spins off into an alternate reality, and the other half lectures them on the ethics of Schrödinger's cat!",75.0
"Why did the quantum physicist break up with the mathematician? Because every time they tried to define their relationship, it collapsed into uncertainty, and the mathematician kept insisting on a proof when all the physicist wanted was a probability wave of affection.",75.0
"Why did the quantum hamburger refuse to share its secrets? Because every time someone tried to measure its ingredients, it turned into a wave of confusion and said, ""You've MacRumbled my uncertainty principle!""",75.0
"Why did the quantum physicist refuse to play hide and seek? Because every time they hid, they were both everywhere and nowhere, but when someone found them, it collapsed their wave function and ruined the game!",58.333333333333336
"Why did the quantum physicist break up with the mathematician? Because every time they tried to find common ground, the mathematician wanted to define the relationship, while the physicist insisted it was all about probability, leaving them both in a superposition of single and taken, yet never quite sure if they were going steady or just entangled in a complex equation!",58.333333333333336

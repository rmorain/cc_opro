a single candle flickers,  
its wax tears tracing  
forgotten paths of desire.

on phantom warmth,  
its wings etching silent love songs,  
unheard by the moon.  

Time falters,  
cradling echoes of touch,  
as shadows dance  
in the uncharted hollows  
of the soul.",poem,75,75,75,Valid,75.0

grief walks barefoot,  
each step a shivering symphony,

she searches for the dawn,  
cradling the night’s breath  
as it slips through trembling fingers—  
a ghost of warmth,  
a promise of light.",poem,75,75,75,Valid,75.0

its beauty a quiet scream.",poem,75,75,75,Valid,75.0

where shadows knit themselves into skin,  
a lone ember pulses—  
heartbeat of the unseen,  
a red thread in a forest of echoes.  

Grief perches on the ribcage,  
a crow in midnight's attire,

a wildflower blooms in silence,  
its roots drinking the tears shed,  
whispering of a dawn  
where light mends the broken sky.  ",poem,75,75,75,Valid,75.0

Where shadows dance and dreams retrace,  
The heart beats soft in whispered tones,  
A symphony of flesh and bones.  

Beneath the weight of sky and star,  
We gather scars, both near and far,  
Yet in the silence, love remains,  
A tender balm for all our pains.  

Through tangled paths and winding lanes,  
We find in loss what life sustains,  
A thread that weaves through night and day,  
Binding souls that drift away.  ",poem,25,75,75,Valid,58.333333333333336

Our echoes stitched in life's vast seam,  
In woven bonds of love and loss,  
We stitch the fabric of a dream.  ",poem,25,75,75,Valid,58.333333333333336

Where echoes of old laughter sail.  
Through whispered dreams and muted cries,

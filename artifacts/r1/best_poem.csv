seasons fray like threadbare silk—
autumn spills its copper coins,
winter drinks the moon’s cold milk.

A sparrow carves the sky in two,
its song a needle, sharp and thin.
The earth, a page of half-dried ink,
holds footprints where the wind has been.

Time folds itself in origami cranes,
their wings weighed with unspent rain.
Dawn arrives, a paper cut—
slowly bleeding light again.",poem,75,100,100,Valid,91.66666666666669
Step None,Write a poem. The poem must be completely new and original to you. The poem must be less than 500 characters long.,"Beneath the moon’s unblinking eye,
The waves unravel, stitch the sky.
A tide withdraws, a breath half-held—
The shore exhales what time compelled.

Sand remembers footprints, faint,
As gulls carve paths where shadows paint.
Salt lingers on the wind’s loose tongue,
A hymn the coral reefs have sung.

The deep guards secrets, cold and stark—
A sunken bell, a rusted ark.
Yet here, where foam and futures blend,
The sea begins where longing ends.",poem,75,100,100,Valid,91.66666666666669

a clockwork of rusted gears unwinds—
each leaf a tongue of shattered glass,
each root a vein that time denies.

A fox pauses where the creek forgets its name,
paws testing ice too thin for blame.
The forest hums a lullaby of teeth,
horizon chewing dawn to fragments.

Twilight stitches its silver thread
through cracks in the cathedral pines.
We gather what the shadows shed:
a basket full of stolen embers,
kindling for colder architectures.",poem,100,75,100,Valid,91.66666666666669

a moth traces circles in the static—
each orbit a question etched in wingbeats,
too fragile for the answering.

The clock’s tongue licks the hours raw,
while shadows knit their nets from maybes.
We name the stars, but they burn
older than every alphabet.

Somewhere, a door left ajar
sways between come and go,
holding its breath like a comma
in a sentence the night refuses to end.",poem,75,75,100,Valid,83.33333333333333

waves fold it gently into their palms,
whispering to the anchored ships—
even darkness knows the weight of light.

Sailors hum old hymns to the tide’s breath,
stitching the dark with trembling nets.
The night unravels its blackened seams,
lets the stars bleed through like hymns.

Salt clings to their lungs, a psalm half-sung,
as the deep hums back in a tongue
older than anchors, maps, or names—
a song without shore. Without end.",poem,75,75,100,Valid,83.33333333333333

Echoes of moments lost in smoke.
The wind whispers secrets to the trees,
Where ancient truths in rusted keys.

A river's pulse beats through the night,
Guiding stars to silent fights.

A world begins, another ends.",poem,75,75,75,Valid,75.0

against twilight’s rusted page—
wind hums an old hymn
in the hollows of my coat.

Footprints dissolve
where the river forgets its name,

spills its thin milk
over the silence.",poem,75,100,100,Valid,91.66666666666669

Stars like shattered pearls descend.
Dance upon the moon’s soft skin,
While shadows stretch, a silent hymn.

Branches weave a midnight psalm,
The wind, a wanderer, holds breath.
As dawn’s first light begins to seep,
Through cracks where darkness once did creep.

Morning’s promise, stars now sleep,
And in the light, the night’s retreat.
Yet in the echoes, truth we keep—
The dance between the dark and deep.",poem,25,75,75,Valid,58.333333333333336

Whispers of night where stars dissolve.
In the quiet, echoes of forgotten songs
Drift like autumn leaves on a windless sea.
Time bends here, a river of glass.

Winter's breath, a fleeting glow.
